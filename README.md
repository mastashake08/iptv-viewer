# IPTV Viewer

IPTV Viewer is a Vue 3-based Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with Vite. It allows users to load and play `.m3u8` or `.m3u` files via drag-and-drop or file launchers. The app integrates with the Media Session API for enhanced media control, enabling playback control from system-level media controls.

- **File Launcher Integration**: Open `.m3u8` or `.m3u` files directly from the system file launcher.
- **Media Session API**: Control playback (play, pause, seek, etc.) using system media controls (e.g., lock screen, notification area).
